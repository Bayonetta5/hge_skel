What we have now:

* MyGame class - all the static stuff from hgetut06 moved inside it.

* GameState class. Its a piece of code which handles drawing and input, and can
be switched on the fly when user changes game mode (like clicks options or
instructions or starts a game).

* GameState for Main Menu, MainMenu GUI from hgetut06 moved to this GameState, as
it belongs to main menu only and never pops up anywhere later until we return to
main menu.

* GameState for Instructions - 2 page instructions with menu items to switch
between them and return to main menu. It has separate HGE GUI for displaying
text labels with instructions (configurable on top of game_state.cpp) and
switching between pages.

* Some variables were renamed on the way, to more recognizable (like global
HTEXTURE tex was moved inside MyGame class and renamed to m_mouse_cursor_tex)
you should get the idea.
